## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- Any SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) - the application works with any database schema
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhiramDwivedi/table-stakes.git
cd table-stakes
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   
   The repository includes an `.env.example` file that you can use as a template. Copy it to create your own `.env.local` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit the `.env.local` file to add your specific configuration:

```env
# Database connection (replace with your database details)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql

# OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. (Optional) Run the database setup script:

```bash
node setup-database.js
```

This step is optional and only necessary if you want to set up a sample database with example data. Table Stakes is designed to work with any existing database schema.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Using Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker to run the application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage Examples

Here are some example queries you can try:

- "Find all new enrollments in the last week"
- "Show how enrollments changed week by week over last quarter"
- "List customers in California with orders over $1000"
- "What was the total revenue last month?"
- "Create a chart of enrollments by course"
- "Compare sales by store location"

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Table Stakes uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing. Tests cover individual components, utility functions, and integration between components.

To run unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run tests with coverage report:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

Key test areas include:

- **Component Tests**: Ensure UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions
- **API Tests**: Verify API routes function correctly with mock data
- **Utility Function Tests**: Validate helper functions, data formatting, and business logic
- **Hook Tests**: Test custom hooks for proper state management and side effects

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that various parts of the application work together correctly:

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

These tests focus on:

- Query processing flow from natural language to SQL
- Database connection and query execution
- Visualization generation from query results
- User interactions across multiple components

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests use Playwright to simulate real user workflows:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

These tests validate complete user journeys such as:
- Connecting to a database
- Submitting natural language queries
- Receiving and interacting with results
- Exporting data and visualizations

### Security Testing

#### OWASP Top 10 Scanning

Table Stakes implements security testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, focusing on the OWASP Top 10:

```bash
pnpm security:scan
```

This runs automated security scanning using tools like:
- OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) for dynamic application security testing
- Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning
- ESLint security plugins for static code analysis

#### Key Security Areas Tested:

1. **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection prevention in the query processor
2. **Broken Authentication**: API route protection and authentication flow testing
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Proper handling of database credentials and API keys
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Input validation and sanitization
5. **Broken Access Control**: Authorization checks and permission validation
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Environment setup and server configuration validation
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Input/output encoding and Content Security Policy testing
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Safe data handling and processing
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Dependency scanning and updates
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Audit logging for security-relevant events

### Performance Testing

Performance tests ensure the application remains responsive under load:

```bash
pnpm test:performance
```

These tests measure:
- Response times for natural language query processing
- Database query execution time
- Visualization rendering performance
- Application behavior under concurrent user load

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests verify the application meets WCAG guidelines:

```bash
pnpm test:a11y
```

This runs automated accessibility checks using tools like axe-core and pa11y.

## Technical Architecture

Table Stakes is built using a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Recharts for interactive data visualization
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **API**: Next.js API routes for server-side logic

The application follows this high-level flow:

1. User inputs a natural language query
2. The query is transformed into SQL using OpenAI's language models
3. SQL is executed against the database
4. Results are processed and analyzed by the AI
5. Appropriate visualizations are generated based on data and query intent
6. Results and insights are presented to the user

## Customizing for Your Data

Table Stakes is designed to work with any database schema without modifications. The application dynamically adapts to your database structure when you connect to it.

However, you can optimize the experience by:

1. Ensuring your database connection is properly configured in your `.env.local` file
2. Reviewing and adjusting the database interface in `lib/database/interface.ts` if needed
3. Optionally customizing the prompts in `lib/openai.ts` to better describe your specific data model
