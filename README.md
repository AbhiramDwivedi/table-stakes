## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhiramDwivedi/table-stakes.git
cd table-stakes
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
POSTGRES_DB=tablestakes
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

4. Run the database setup script:

```bash
node setup-database.js
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Using Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker to run the application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage Examples

Here are some example queries you can try:

- "Find all new enrollments in the last week"
- "Show how enrollments changed week by week over last quarter"
- "List customers in California with orders over $1000"
- "What was the total revenue last month?"
- "Create a chart of enrollments by course"
- "Compare sales by store location"

## Technical Architecture

Table Stakes is built using a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Recharts for interactive data visualization
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **API**: Next.js API routes for server-side logic

The application follows this high-level flow:

1. User inputs a natural language query
2. The query is transformed into SQL using OpenAI's language models
3. SQL is executed against the database
4. Results are processed and analyzed by the AI
5. Appropriate visualizations are generated based on data and query intent
6. Results and insights are presented to the user

## Customizing for Your Data

To use Table Stakes with your own database schema:

1. Modify the database configuration in `lib/database/postgresql.ts`
2. Update the database schema representation in `lib/database/interface.ts`
3. Adjust the schema information in the prompts in `lib/openai.ts`
